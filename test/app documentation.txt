I want to build food app with flutter.

First of all check the following entities and relationships find errors and mistakes, rewrite all of them:
1. User
	id, user_name, password
2. Product
	id, product_name, description, category_id, quantity, image_url, 
3. Category
	id, category_name
4. Orders
	id, date, user_id, list_of_products(user_cart_details), total, pickup/delivery, payment_method_id, status_id, address_id
5. Cart
	id, user_id, product_list(product_id, quantity), total
6. PaymentMethod
	id, name	
7. Status
	id, name
8. Address
	id, user_id, address
9. Rating
	id, product_id, rating(out of 5), user_id
10. Review
	id, product_id, review, user_id
11. Item
	product_id, quantity

Second thing is:
For folder structure i want to use clean architecture(datasource/domain/presentaion per feature)
For state management i want to use riverpod
For backend i want to use firebase(no sdk and cloud simple realtime database to which i can send http requests)

Now i am super confused, how i can divide my app into features(how many features should be)?
If one feature is depended on another feature how i can hanndle them?

Main features of app:
Authorization and authentication (admin user)
admin manages products users and orders
users can place order login signup and view orders

// use equatable for object comparision
// dartz for Either
